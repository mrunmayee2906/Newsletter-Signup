# Newsletter-Signup
Node.js project: Sign up page for a newsletter which asks for name and email of the person wanting to subscribe to the newsletter.

The subscriber list is stored in a MailChimp audience list.
When a person enters the details, it checks if the email is already subscribed or not in the existing audience list.
If the email is already subscribed, the user is taken to a page which displays the message that the person is already subscribed.
If not, the user's details are added to the list and is taken to a page which displays the message the person is successfully subscribed.

The project requires environment variables API_KEY, SERVER and LIST_ID from a .env file.
The API_KEY for the Mailchimp Marketing API can be generated by creating an account on [Mailchimp](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup/).
Follow the [starting guide](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/quick-start/) to get started.
